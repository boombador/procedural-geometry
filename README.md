# Procedural Geometry in Elm

This project is an exploration of elm in the form of a library for generating meshes for use with 
[elm-community/webgl](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/webgl/latest). In other words
no guarantees for your production server.

## Setup

This project uses yarn and elm, both of which are available as npm packages:

    npm install -g yarn elm

Once those dependencies are installed you can rely on the package managers:

    yarn install
    elm package install

Note: These instructions haven't been attempted from a fresh install.

## Running

Start the server, then go to [localhost:3000]() (or your custom development IP at the
same port):

    yarn start
